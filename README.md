# CST311 Assignments

## Note: it is important to ensure that the repository is _private_ so other teams cannot access your code. 

Please see [setting up a private fork](setting_up_a_private_fork.md) for details on how to make a private fork.


## Overview

This repository contains programming assignments for CST311.

Please note that assignments may change up until assignment date (and potentially after if there is confusion).
Therefore, if you start assignments prior to their official submission date please make sure to update your local repository (see [updating](#updating) section below for more details).

## Getting started

To start working on projects please following the directions in [Setting up a private fork](setting_up_a_private_fork.md) to set up a private repository.
After you fork, [invite your team members to share](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository)

## Found a problem??

When you find a problem let us know about it!
Send us a message on slack and/or follow one of the options below.

You can help fix problems in one of two ways:
1. Open an issue on github and describe what seems to be wrong!
   - This the better option for when something is confusing or open-ended and needs clarification.
   - You can find instructions for creating an issue [here](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue)
2. Fix the issue on your local version and submit a pull request!  
   - This is the better option for when you found a bug in the starter code and want to show off your coding skills.
   - You can find instructions for opening a pull request [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
   

## Peer Evaluation

For each project it is important to fill out the [peer evaluation form](https://forms.gle/vtt31GjK9Rrerews5).
Failure to do so will result in a 0 for your peer evaluation rating leading to a loss of some points.
