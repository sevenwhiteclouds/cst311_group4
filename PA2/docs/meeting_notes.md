### Meeting 1: Requirements and Strategy
For our initial meeting for Project 2, as a team, we reviewed the project requirements and discusse 
any questions or concerns that came up. This helped the entire team gain a better understanding of 
this project and identify potential challenges we may encounter while working towards completing it.

Addtionally, we also worked together to create a strategy that we all could agree on for dividing 
responsibilities and work among the team. We considered the difficulty of this project and how much 
work was required to ensure that everyone was assigned tasks equally. We also established a 
timeline with specific deadlines to keep us on track and make steady progress toward our 
goal of completing this project, and we also set up our next meeting time and date.

To get everyone up to speed, we also assisted each other in setting up our GitHub accounts to work 
with the shared repository and the basics of using Git. We tested and learned about being able to 
pull, commit, and push changes. Additionally, we set up different branches for each other's 
individual work. Doing all these things allowed us to collaborate more effectively and work more 
efficiently on this project.

Overall, our first meeting was productive and successful. We set up a strong foundation for the 
project

### Meeting 2: Solution Overview, Math, Bug Fixes, and Next Steps 
During our second team meeting for Project 2, we worked on important tasks that improved 
our implementation for this project. First, we ensured that the code we wrote met the 
agreed-upon standards. During this process, we identified areas that needed 
improvement, particularly in the mathematical aspects of our solution. Once we addressed 
this issue, we brought everyone up to speed with our solution, 
ensuring clarity and resolving any confusion.

Additionally, we also fixed a couple bugs that came up after modifying our mathematical 
calculations. We thoroughly double-checked the results to ensure they matched our 
expectations after the bug fixes. Lastly, we scheduled a date and time for our next 
meeting to maintain the consistent progress and stay on track for the project's due date.

### Meeting 3: Code Review, Output Validation, and Wrap-Up
During our third and final meeting for Project 2, we successfully concluded the remaining tasks. 
Firstly, we conducted a thorough review of the final code, ensuring its accuracy and efficiency. 
We paid special attention to any potential bugs or optimizations needed. Secondly, we took the 
time to double-check the output on each team member's mininet instance to guarantee consistency 
across all environments. We examined the results, confirming that they aligned with 
the project requirements. We also made an effort to enhance the program's documentation. 
We added comprehensive comments that explained some of the intricacies of the code, 
facilitating better understanding for whoever reads it. Finally, an update and finalization of 
the meeting notes, capturing all essential discussions, decisions, and action items 
for future reference was performed. The final meeting was productive and marked the 
successful completion of Project 2.
