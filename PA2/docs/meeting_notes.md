### Meeting 1: Requirements and Strategy
> For our initial meeting for Project 2, as a team, we reviewed the project requirements and discussed any questions or concerns that came up. This helped the entire team gain a better understanding of this project and identify potential challenges we may encounter while working towards completing it.
>
> Addtionally, we also worked together to create a strategy that we all could agree on for dividing responsibilities and work among the team. We considered the difficulty of this project and how much work was required to ensure that everyone was assigned tasks equally. We also established a timeline with specific deadlines to keep us on track and make steady progress toward our goal of completing this project, and we also set up our next meeting time and date.
>
> To get everyone up to speed, we also assisted each other in setting up our GitHub accounts to work with the shared repository and the basics of using Git. We tested and learned about being able to pull, commit, and push changes. Additionally, we set up different branches for each other's individual work. Doing all these things allowed us to collaborate more effectively and work more efficiently on this project.
>
> Overall, our first meeting was productive and successful. We set up a strong foundation for the project
