Project 3: Meeting Notes
Attendees: Keldin M., Stacy K., Steven C., Samuel U.

Meeting 1: Overview and discussion of requirements

For the first meeting, we looked at the requirements of Project 3, which helped the group understand the expectations
fot this projects. We also looked at the extra credit options and decided we would probably work on those once the
main requirements are done. As a group, we discussed how multithreading will be important for this project. We also
discussed how there are different ways to dictate which client sends the first message. After some strategizing and
planning on how this assignment can be done, we decided that we can each individually begin working on the project and
will discuss each others code at the next meeting. Everyone's code should be able to have 2 clients establish a TCP
connection and at least an attempt to get the server to have a message with the respective client's message in the order
they were received.
